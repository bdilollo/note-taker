## Description
This application utilizes Node.js and Express.js, as well as a number of NPMs, to save and display notes entered by the user. The back-end server listens for different GET and POST requests on several different routes, and performs different functions for each. By reading and writing to a JSON file, the data persists upon reload.

## Installation
The repo contains a package.json with the necessary dependencies. Run ```npm install``` in terminal to install dependencies, then ```node server.js``` to launch server using a local port. To access the deployed application, navigate to the application URL (found at the top of the README).
